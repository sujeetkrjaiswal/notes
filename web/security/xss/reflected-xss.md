# Reflected XSS

Unlike Persistent XSS, with Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacker-supplied script code is never stored within the application itself. Instead the attacker crafts a malicious request to the application to illicit a single HTTP response by the application that contains the attacker's supplied script code. Successful attacks require victim users to open a maliciously crafted link (which is very easy to do).

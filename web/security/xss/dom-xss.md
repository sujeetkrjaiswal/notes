# DOM XSS

To defend against Cross-Site Scripting attacks in a Document Object Model (DOM) environment, a defense-in-depth approach is required, combining several security best practices.\
\
You should recall that Stored XSS and Reflected XSS injections take place server-side rather than client-side. With DOM XSS, the attack is injected into the browserâ€™s DOM thus adding complexity by making it very difficult to prevent and highly context specific (because an attacker can inject HTML, HTML Attributes, or CSS as well as URLs).\
\
As a general set of principles, the application should first HTML-encode and then JavaScript-encode any user-supplied data that is returned to the client.\
\
Due to the very broad attack surface, developers are strongly encouraged to review areas of code that are potentially susceptible to DOM XSS, including but not limited to:\
\
`window.name` `document.referrer` `document.URL` `document.documentURI` `location` `location.href` `location.search` `location.hash` `eval` `setTimeout` `setInterval` `document.write` `document.writeIn` `innerHTML` `outerHTML`\
